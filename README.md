Hopefully this will be not just another try of 'too' big project.

I developed quite a while in python, especially with the module pygame. My first game was a rebuild of an old arcade game. Later I tried more in complicated game-logic, but never finished the project. Loosing ambition after you got the basic stuff running is my biggest problem. After that, tasks requiring great diligence, and you work two hours on code that does nothing special.

...but that's called coding, I guess.

# Resa (FAQ)

###Resa?
Resa is swedish and means 'journey' or 'to travel'. Me loving strategic build up games like Anno and Age of Empires, try now something like that in python wih pygame.

### Why python and not another, more efficient language for game development?
First, because it's possible. Second, I like using Apple Products and all my favorite games are not playable on MacOS anymore. I could hate Apple for that or the developer that they concentrate only on one or two systems, but that's not my interest. I like python, because its programs can be executed nearly anywhere, and it provides good working modules for what I'm going for.

### What is the game about?
Simple and very straight forward. You are a lord or king or whatever and get into an unknown, island based, world. You got your ship, some materials and some money. Now you need to develop your chosen island into a great trading and self-sustaining city. If you lose all your money or your population ist starving to death or leaves your city for other reasons you are defeated.

I try to mix everything I like about the 'good old' strategic games I've played so much in childhood.

### Which game engine is used?
None. I try to use only python and pygame to develop everything. There is no engine like OpenGL even though it is an existing python module.

### Using pre-created code or graphics?
No. My goal is to do anything from scratch. Of course, I will be using snippets from my old projects, but I like the idea of re-think everything. Same for graphics. That's the most difficult part for me. Good graphics improve the feeling so much, and I am not a designer. Using Gimp and my fantasy is hopefully enough until I implemented a texture pack functionality.

If I use something I found in the virtual or real word, I will credit it in my source code and here.

### Everything is free to use?
Code, graphics and what else is hosted in this repository is published under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 3. I do that for fun and in my free time.

### Is there a way to help?
Yeah, sure. For this repository I created a wiki. My personal goal is a documentation of the code for developers and about the development process, like a blog or articles about my thought behind a game function.

If you are a python **programmer**, I guess you have ideas to improve my source code. Go for it and open issues or pull requests.
If you are a **gamer**, perfect. Open issues here too. Every feedback is helpful.
If you are a **designer**, nice. Please wait until I implemented something to support different texture packages. Before that, all your work could be for nothing and I do not want to waste your time.

### Which version is playable?
Versioning will be simple. First number is for major releases. Second number is for minor releases. Third one for bug-fixes and little changes.

Major releases will be created under one of two conditions:
- massive changes and big improvements
- changes that are not backward compatible

Everything until I reach 1.0.0 is mentioned as not playable or alpha-version.

### How long will it take?
Long. As I mentioned, I developed some tiny games with python and pygame before. I can tell that it is time-consuming. My coding skills are far away from great and free time is nothing you can buy.

It is possible that I take some breaks, cause of a lack of motivation or to (re)think some ideas. To be up-to-date, 'watch' this repository on GitHub.

### Let's see how far I will get...
