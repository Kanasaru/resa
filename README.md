# Resa
Resa is swedish and means 'journey' or 'to travel'. Me loving strategic build up games like Anno and Age of Empires, try now something like that in python wih pygame.

## Installation
You need to install python3 and pygame2. Download Resa source code.

## Usage
Run *main.py* in Resa root folder.

## Contributing
Yeah, sure. For this repository I created a wiki. My personal goal is a documentation of the code for developers and about the development process, like a blog or articles about my thought behind a game function.

- If you are a python **programmer**, I guess you have ideas to improve my source code. Go for it and open issues or pull requests.
- If you are a **gamer**, perfect. Open issues here too. Every feedback is helpful.
- If you are a **designer**, nice. Please wait until I implemented something to support different texture packages. Before that, all your work could be for nothing and I do not want to waste your time.
